# OpRec

A giant work in progress crate that can transform functions. It is planned to support inverses (solving for variables), derivatives using [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Operator_overloading_(OO)), and integrals using the [Risch Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm).
